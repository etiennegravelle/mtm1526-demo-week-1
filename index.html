 <!--We put the <script> tag at thye bottom of the page for two reasons
 	1. When the browser hits a <script> tag it will delay the rendering of the page, we put <script> at the bottom so the page render's faster
	2. If the Javascript is executed in the <head> the <body> won't be rendered yet so we won't be able to manipulate our HTML -->
